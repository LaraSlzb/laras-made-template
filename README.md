# Correlation between physical activities and mental health

This project was developed as part of the course 'Advanced Methods of Software Engineering' at FAU in the winter semester 2024/25.\
The aim was to find a correlation between physical activity and mental health in American society. To this end, the “Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity Survey” and the “National Survey on Drug Use and Health” were merged in an ETL pipeline on the basis of the common value state and the results analyzed.\
